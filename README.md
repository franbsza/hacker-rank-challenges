Welcome to hacker-rank-challenges repo!

This repository contains some solutions that I did to solve hackerrank challenges.
I am using JUnit 5 to test it.

This could always be upgrade, as I am passionate about challenges and I am continually learning something new.
There are always a lot of to do and it's amazing.

Thanks for reading ;)
